/*** 
   Add your global variables that store the DOM elements you will 
   need to reference and/or manipulate. 
   
   But be mindful of which variables should be global and which 
   should be locally scoped to one of the two main functions you're 
   going to create. A good general rule of thumb is if the variable 
   will only be used inside of a function, then it can be locally 
   scoped to that function.

/*** 
   Create the `showPage` function to hide all of the items in the 
   list except for the ten you want to show.

   Pro Tips: 
     - Keep in mind that with a list of 54 students, the last page 
       will only display four.
     - Remember that the first student has an index of 0.
     - Remember that a function `parameter` goes in the parens when 
       you initially define the function, and it acts as a variable 
       or a placeholder to represent the actual function `argument` 
       that will be passed into the parens later when you call or 
       "invoke" the function

/*** 
   Create the `appendPageLinks function` to generate, append, and add 
   functionality to the pagination buttons.
