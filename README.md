# List Pagination and Filtering
This project will dynamically paginate a students list to avoid long scrolling. Each page will contain maximum of 10 students
and the no. of pages will vary according to the total number of students in the list. There is a search bar so the users can filter specific names or people on the list. If the list is more than 10 students, the list results will also be paginated. If the names or letters in the user's input has no match on the list, a 'No results' text will be displayed on the HTML. The codes contains only vanilla javascript. A knowledge on creating and appending elements is very useful in this project.
